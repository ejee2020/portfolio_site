                <p> I am a recent graduate of UC Berkeley looking for job opportunities as a software engineer. 
                    I majored in Applied Mathematics concentrated in Computer Science. I enjoy solving complicated 
                    problems and understanding abstract ideas and concepts. As a math major, I had to analyze problems 
                    and deconstruct them into abstract mathematical objects and could develop problem solving skills 
                    and learn how to approach intricate problems. Now I want to apply my mathematical knowledge and 
                    problem solving skills to real world problems and make an impact in the society as a software engineer.
